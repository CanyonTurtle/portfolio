## Short term
I've seen firsthand that Claude code, cursor, copilot, windsurf, and related tools are already sophisticated enough
to amplify developer speed (if used prudently). It's clear the industry will continue to shift and fewer human resources will
be required to build any given system. I don't know if this means less jobs necessarily, or just more quantity of software supplied in a more 
prosperous economy.

## Far term
In the far term, I think AI will eventually be able to automate all intellectual and physical work. I see this as posing
two main challenges to humanity:
1. What do we do when we're no longer required by necessity to work?
2. How do we build AI systems so they're safe for humanity, in terms of superintelligence and also in terms of safe usage.
