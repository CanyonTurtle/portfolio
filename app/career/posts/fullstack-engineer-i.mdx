Not only have I grown technically at Redo, but I have also learned an appreciation for the raw speed, ownership, and talent required
to make a startup succeed at the highest level.

While a software engineer I, I helped build a multi-channel support client (especially email), built features for return submission, and helped troubleshoot and author solutions to bugs and issues.
