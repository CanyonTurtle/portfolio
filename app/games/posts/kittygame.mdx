Kittygame started as my attempt to make a game like Downwell - one where there's simple pixel graphics, fast movement, procedural levels, and platforming. I really enjoyed making this especially because I learned both Rust and manual memory management in Rust - this game is only 64KB, but has 9 worlds and multiple game modes.
