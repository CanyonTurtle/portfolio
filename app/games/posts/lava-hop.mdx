This game was a 2-hour project that came from a question: "what would happen if I spent $20 of Claude code credits to program a game?" I kept this strict - I didn't write any code myself. It was really cool to see how far AI coding can go, especially when all the graphics, audio, and inputs are either handled or are authored in-code.
