I've been wanting to put one of these together for a while! Inspired by [https://joshmoody.org/](https://joshmoody.org/). 

## Interesting aspects
Of note:
- Toy example of CI/CD (uses github actions to run `gh-pages`, which publishes the static site)
- Built from [https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-portfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-portfolio)
